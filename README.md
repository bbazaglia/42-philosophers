## üí° About the project

This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.

You can read more about processes, threads, memory, and synchronization on my Medium page: https://medium.com/@beatrizbazaglia/understanding-processes-threads-memory-and-synchronization-e57887567929

## üìù Requirements

‚Ä¢ One or more philosophers sit at a round table with a bowl of spaghetti in the center.

‚Ä¢ They alternate between three states: eating, thinking, and sleeping.

‚Ä¢ Each philosopher requires two forks to eat.

‚Ä¢ Philosophers must not starve; they need to eat regularly.

‚Ä¢ The simulation stops if a philosopher dies of starvation.

‚Ä¢ They do not communicate and do not know when another philosopher is about to starve.

## üìã Testing

To compile, go to the project path and run:

```shell
$ make 
```

Then, execute the program with the following arguments:

```shell
$ ./philo [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep]

* optional and last parameter: [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```
